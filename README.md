Yet Another Set of Starters
===========================
Starter kits for progressive web apps span the spectrum of useless and stale to useful but bloated with the kitchen sink included. For someone coming in to the world of modern web development, especially from a C/C++ background, it can be frustrating - so close to getting started and yet a big disconnect in how it all comes together. 

To be sure, there are excellent articles written on each befuddling topic and each such article typically also provides a pointer to the worked out example. The issue however is that in the web development world, things move at break neck speed and break backward compatibility often. Leaving the article and the accompanying source stale.

Yasos is my attempt to capture my learning and *keep pace with the changes* to the core stack and the build tools. Think of it as a set of examples with a long term support for as long as I remain interested in the web. Rather than create a bunch of repositories, I intend to keep the starters in this repository organized by their complexity and scope.
