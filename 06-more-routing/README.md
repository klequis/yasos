Getting to know React Router 4
==============================

NOTE: The original source for this starter was lifted from [this](https://css-tricks.com/react-router-4/) article. And it was heavilly modified to fit in to a structure that we feel is better.

Features
--------

Development
-----------
> If using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), all instances of `npm` can be replaced with `yarn`. :ok_hand:

### install
```
$ npm install
```

If live-server is not installed globally do so now.

```
# check if live-server is installed
$ which `live-server`

# if not installed, install it now
$ npm install --global live-server
```

### build
```
$ npm run build
```

Compiles all files. Output is sent to the `build` directory.

### start
```
$ npm start
```
Runs your application (from the `build` directory) in the browser.

### watch
```
$ npm run watch
```

Like [`start`](#start), but will auto-compile & auto-reload the server after any file changes within the `app` and `web` directory.

Issues and FAQs
===============
In this section various links that I had to consult in order to get the starter to a working condition are listed.
